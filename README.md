# Genshin Impact Feedback

- Resin refresh rates are horrible
  - Let us store more condensed resin
    - 5 isn't enough!
  - Let us store more original resin
    - Total original resin and resin refresh rate should grow with AR
  - Give us something to do once the world is free from enemies and there is no resin
- Weekly bosses shouldn't have a resin cost.
  - Implement a token system
    - Every weekly reset, you are given x tokens which are used to collect rewards
    - 1 token per boss available
      - As of 1.3, 1 each for Andrius, Dvalin, and Tartaglia
    - Challenge any combination of the bosses, or challenge the same boss 3 times
- Add condensed resin as a reward for completing all 4 turning in daily commissions.
- Add fragile resin as a reward for completing 5 days of cumulative daily commissions
- Battle Pass rewards after level 50
  - Repeat 40-50 but without the primogems?
- Elite and world (Regisvines, Hypostases, Andrius, Primo Geovishap) bosses should be a teleport destination on the map.
- Show pity counter on wishes
  - 3* rewards are terrible
    - There is very little variety
      - Add Mystic Enhancement Ore, Character Experience books, Talent books, Character and Weapon ascension materials
    - Poor value, 9/10 of every 10-pull is approximately $20.37. 9 3* weapons is unacceptable
- Better scaling of drop rates on ascension gems from elite and world bosses
- Better scaling of ley line rewards
  - There is no improvement to rewards after a certain world level
- Prototypes are very hard to find
- Weekly quest for choice of elite boss talent material
  - Amount based on world level
- Weekly quest for highest tier of ascension gem
  - Amount and tier based on world level
- Craft or transmute elite boss drops into ascension gems
- Minimap passive talents need to indicate elevation
- Increased custom map pin cap.
- Bennet's C6 should be a selectable option on his Elemental Burst. Hold elemental burst for field to infuse Pyro
- "Claim all" and "Repeat" option for expeditions.
- Another option other than "Jump" for escaping from hard CC such as Frozen or Bubbles. (Why is it jump?)
- UI for showing remaining shield durability
  - Shields from crystallize reaction should either refresh the durability of the same element shield or apply a new one
  - Different crystallize reaction shields should stack
- 2 factor authentication using a T-OTP app like Authy/Google Authenticator
  - I've spent far too much on Genshin Impact to lose my account
- Cicins shouldn't be immune to Venti's Elemental Burst
- Display amount in inventory while crafting
- Provide a way to review past dialog
- Addition of weapon transmog option. (Style is important.)
- Keep Theater Mechanicus around
  - Love some RTS in my Genshin
- More things to do in the Adventurer Book
- Adventurer Book tracking more than 6 enemies in the map
  - I do not want to look up an online interactive map everytime
  - Show enemies on minimap
- Ruin Grader not counting as a ruin guard in the the adventurer book
