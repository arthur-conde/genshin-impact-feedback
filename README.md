# Genshin Impact Feedback

- Elite and world (Regisvines, Hypostases, Andrius, Primo Geovishap) bosses should be a teleport destination on the map.
- Increased custom map pin cap.
- Weekly bosses shouldn't have a resin cost
- Better scaling of drop rates on ascension gems from elite and world bosses
- Better scaling of ley line rewards
  - There is no improvement to rewards after a certain world level
- Prototypes are very hard to find
- Weekly quest for choice of elite boss talent material
  - Amount based on world level
- Weekly quest for highest tier of ascension gem
  - Amount and tier based on world level
- Show pity counter on wishes
- Bennet's C6 should be a selectable option on his Elemental Burst. Hold elemental burst for field to infuse Pyro
- "Claim all" and "Repeat" option for character expeditions.
- Another option other than "Jump" for escaping from hard CC such as Frozen or Bubbles. (Why is it jump?)
- UI for showing remaining shield durability
  - Crystallize reaction shields should either refresh the durability of the same element shield or apply a new one
  - Different crystallize reaction shields should stack
- 2 factor authentication using a T-OTP app like Authy/Google Authenticator
  - I've spent far too much on Genshin Impact to lose my account
- Cicins shouldn't be immune to Venti's Elemental Burst
- Display amount in inventory while crafting
- Provide a way to review past dialog
- Resin refresh rates are horrible
  - Let us store more condensed resin
  - Let us store more original resin
  - Give us something to do once the world is free from enemies and there is no resin
  - Allow Resin Regen to scale with AR (-2 seconds per AR, Ex: AR30 Traveler have -60sec base regen timer, so 1 resin per 7min.)
- Add a condensed resin as a reward for turning in daily commissions.
- Battle Pass Evergreen rewards for those that reach Rank50 early (Something simple, Mora/Ore/Xp, something.)
- Addition of weapon transmog option. (Style is important.)
- Keep Theater Mechanicus around
  - Love some RTS in my Genshin
- More things to do in the Adventurer Book
- adventurer book tracking more than 6 enemies in the map (I do not want to look up an online interactive map everytime.)
- Ruin grader not counting as a ruin guard in the the adventurer book
- Craft elite boss drops into ascension gems
